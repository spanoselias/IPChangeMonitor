# Real-Time data synchronization tool 
Real-Time replication tool will be mainly used to backup critical files from a local, or remote location.
The idea is to have a new version in every backup by using smart data structures (tree - holds the version in every backup).
Sophisticated algorithms should be used in order in every new backup version the size of the new backup should only be
the new files added. If somebody want to be a collaborator and continue development, please open an issue.
